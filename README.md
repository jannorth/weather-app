## Description

AS A traveler

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly


GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city


THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city


THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
